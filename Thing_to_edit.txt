DONE! 1. Edit the code to get the gpus without specifying their names, just by count.

DONE! 2. Add the slurm file for training

3. Add the slurm file for sampling

DONE! 4. All users should use the /checkpoint/${USER} directory for checkpointingn NOT /checkpoint/${USER}/${SLURM_JOB_ID}. /checkpoint/${USER}/${SLURM_JOB_ID} is automatically created for you to perform checkpointing

5. Edit the .slrm file so that it runs again in case of interruption. Make sure you see:
     resume_checkpoint=None, #"/results/pretrainedmodel.pt"
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
     in the segmentation_train.py



6. Unzip the data, and make sure the names match with what the code expects.



For 5, I am trying to comment the waltime to see what happens. The code is a bit complicated regrding the checkpointing. 
Lets see what happens.
